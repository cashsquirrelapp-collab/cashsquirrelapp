# Phase-one release - document copy follow-up

Prepared 2026-10-19. The initial phase-one source is deployed from GitHub commit `7dbf9c8a88ce9206183e96e56da1075e58a86c0d`, active Cloudflare version prefix `d2a836a5`. This package contains the copy follow-up found during guest browser QA; its own Cloudflare deployment and live verification remain pending.

## Source integrity

- Files: 538
- Source bytes: 19509525
- Archive SHA256: `b6003439345565fa7a2eae25a98d73e46e2d59fbdcdc72a602dfd28eda085de4`

- Identical reviewed 538-file allowlist: zero files added or removed. Exactly four source files changed from the initial phase-one package; the other 534 source files are byte-identical.
- Changes are limited to document heading/subtitle copy, its shared header prop, translations, and the corresponding end-to-end regression specification.
- No secrets, dependency directories, generated build output, or symlinks are included. The four-file upload does not contain root Wrangler configuration.
- Verify: `node prepare-release.mjs --verify-only`

## Release behavior

Reversible ordinary-user navigation exposes Overview, Income/Expenses, Jobs, Calendar, invoice/receipt/tax invoice documents, and Feedback. Same-account trusted admins retain all prior features. Hidden data and deferred feature code remain intact. Legacy document import is additive. Public landing and billing copy match phase one; prior editorial components remain available behind a flag.

Feedback adds simple user threads and an independent admin inbox with replies/status. API session/ownership/admin/CSRF checks, atomic SQL, RLS and service-only privileges protect private conversations.

Guest browser QA of the initial deployed release found the document subtitle still mentioning quotations. This follow-up limits ordinary-user document copy to the three released document types while retaining the full admin copy and deferred quotation implementation.

## Deployment status and order

1. The owner explicitly approved publishing the reviewed four-file release package to the public repository and requested that deferred features be retained for future gradual launches.
2. Applied `database/feedback_phase_one.sql` once to `rcllghixkclvkxhvttaw` before the initial release. Verified two RLS-enabled tables, no anon/authenticated table privileges, and three service-only SECURITY INVOKER functions with empty search_path. Service-role create/reply/status/detail/admin-list smoke test passed in a transaction whose test writes were rolled back. Do not reapply.
3. Initial phase one is live at `https://kraroktunngern.cashsquirrelapp.workers.dev`, GitHub commit `7dbf9c8a88ce9206183e96e56da1075e58a86c0d`, active Cloudflare version prefix `d2a836a5`.
4. Upload only `source.tar.gz`, `source-manifest.json`, `prepare-release.mjs`, and this `DEPLOY_SNAPSHOT.md` to repository `cashsquirrelapp-collab/cashsquirrelapp`, branch `cloudflare-production-20261018`, directory `cloudflare-release` for this follow-up.
5. Keep the existing ROOT `wrangler.jsonc`, 15 encrypted Secrets and both cron triggers unchanged. This candidate intentionally omits root Wrangler config.
6. Verify the follow-up Cloudflare Ready/active version and its document copy. Live feedback UI verification is in progress separately; do not infer completion from package checks.

## Validation and limitations

- Follow-up TypeScript, Cloudflare check (16/16 tests) and Cloudflare build passed.
- Initial package: 29 targeted phase-one/document/feedback tests passed, including PGlite permissions, ownership and atomic rollback. Those runtime implementations are unchanged by this follow-up.
- Static normal/admin desktop/mobile/settings and Thai/English feedback markup checks passed for the initial package.
- Initial release has received live guest browser QA. The four isolated Playwright scenarios typecheck and are discovered; they have NOT executed because standalone Chromium launch was blocked by OS sandbox permissions. The changed regression specification is included but not claimed as executed.
- Prior full unit run: 263/268 passed; all five failures reproduce identically in untouched v3. They concern pre-existing notification status and monthly-report calculations/format expectations. Relevant files remain unchanged.
- Existing authenticated APIs and previously enabled LINE notifications remain; existing users retain opt-out/disconnect controls.
- Rollback: redeploy the initial phase-one source if needed, retaining the additive feedback tables/data. Do not drop customer feedback or deferred feature data.
